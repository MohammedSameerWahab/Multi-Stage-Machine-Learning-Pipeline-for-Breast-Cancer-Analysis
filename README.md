# Breast Cancer Detection & Subtype Classification

This repository contains work on two projects focusing on cancer detection and subtype classification using machine learning models. The workflow includes **data cleaning**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.

## üß™ Project 1: Cancer Detection

- **Goal**: Detect whether a patient has breast cancer (binary classification).  
- **Dataset**: `data/p1-dataset/`  
- **Model Performance**:  
  - ‚úÖ Validation Accuracy: **99%**  
  - ‚úÖ Test Accuracy: **98%**  

This project achieved **high performance**, showing that the features used were strongly predictive for the cancer detection task.

## üß™ Project 2: Subtype Classification

- **Goal**: Identify the specific **subtype of cancer** (multi-class classification).  
- **Dataset**: `data/p2-cleande-data/`  
- **Model Performance**:  
  - ‚úÖ Validation Accuracy: **85%**  
  - ‚úÖ Test Accuracy: **87%**  

This project was more challenging due to multiple cancer subtypes, but the results still indicate strong classification ability.
